## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression to Predict MPG](https://github.com/MattK1454/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/linear_model_analysis.png)

Looking at the results of the multi-variable linear regession, the variables/coefficients providing a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are:
- Vehicle_weight
- Spoiler_angle
- AWD

As there are variables/coefficients in the linear model contributing non-random variance, we can not reject the null hypothesis of the linear model and can therefore assume the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

The linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes as the intercept result from the linear regression analysis shows a p-value of 5.08e-08. The 5.08e-08 value shows the variables in the linear regression analysis return a result well within the confidence interval for the test.
